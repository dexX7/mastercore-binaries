mastercore-binaries
===================

This is where we host Master Core binaries.


Check the `releases` tab for downloads and instructions.

API documentation can be found at the main repo here: https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/mastercore/blob/michael-0921/doc/apidocumentation.md

Mastercore should be run with -txindex enabled. If this confuses you, check the README for configuration instructions: https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/mastercore#installation


Thanks,
The Core Team
